# pid_lotto
Fetch lotto results from web and play lotto with your Unix PIDs

# Usage
Just call 
```
./main_business_logic.sh
``` 
and an interactive Terminal GUI will guide
you through all the steps of lotto result fetching and tip generation.  
At the end it will show you your lotto tip and if you would have won with this tip, 
if you had played lotto with it every week the last 30 years.

# Colleagues
This software was created for the seminar 
```
Bottom-Up Datenverarbeitung auf der UNIX-Kommandozeile
```
together with:
  * Alexander Vogelang
  * Manuel Marshall
  
## Who did what
 * The "generate lotto guess from PIDs"-part and the interactive terminal GUI are by me (richi235).
 * Most of the talk preparation and the "fetch loto tips from web" part are by Alexander and Manuel.
   * I no longer know how they partitioned the work among each other.
